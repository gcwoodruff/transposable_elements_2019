Here are brief descriptions of the code and data associated with Woodruff and Teterina 2019 "Degradation of the repetitive genomic landscape in a close relative of _C. elegans_."

If there are any questions about this please contact me at gavincw@uoregon.edu.


These are the assembly, gff, protein, and software versions used here.
```

```

This is the code used to annotate repetitive sequences in genome sequences and to generate the data for the paper.
```
repeats.sh
```

This was used for models, hypothesis tests, and estimating effect sizes.
```
statistics.R
```

This was used to make figures.
```
figures.R
```

Most of the data generated for the paper are in the folder "data."

Scripts and data for evolutionary simulations published in MBE are in the folder "simulations_and_ages/simulations" (by Anastasia Teterina based on recipe 13.6 "Modeling transposable elements" in the SLiM manual v3.0).

Scripts and data used for estimating TE ages published in MBE are in the folder "simulations_and_ages/ages_landscapes."

Additional scripts to make "repeat.sh" work are in the folder "scripts" (I did not write all of these; thanks everyone for sharing).

Additional .pdf's showing the genomic landscapes and distributions of various repeat taxa, insertion ages, and insertion lengths are in the folder "supplemental_figures." There are even **more** supplemental figures in the folder "/revision/supplemental_figures."
