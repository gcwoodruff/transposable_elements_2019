Here are brief descriptions of the code and data associated with Woodruff and Teterina 2019 "Degredation of the repetitive genomic landscape in a close relative of _C. elegans_."

If there are any questions about this please contact me at gavincw@uoregon.edu.


These are the assembly, gff, protein, and software versions used here.
```
genome_gff_protein_software_versions.txt
```

This is the code used to annotate repetitive sequences in genome sequences and to generate the data for the paper.
```
repeats.sh
```

This was used for models, hypothesis tests, and estimating effect sizes.
```
statistics.R
```

This was used to make figures.
```
figures.R
```

The data generated for the paper are in the folder "data."

Scripts for evolutionary simulations are in "SLiM_scripts" (by Anastasia Teterina based on recipe 13.6 "Modeling transposable elements" in the SLiM manual v3.0).

Additional scripts to make "repeat.sh" work are in the folder "scripts" (I did not write all of these; thanks everyone for sharing).

Additional repeat libraries used for repeat annotation are in the folder "additional_repeat_libraries."

Additional .pdf's showing the genomic landscapes and distributions of various repeat taxa, insertion ages, and insertion lengths are in the folder "supplemental_figures."
